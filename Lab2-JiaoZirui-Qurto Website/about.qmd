## Interests & Reading

When it comes to interests, reading is an indispensable part of my life. From literary masterpieces to science fiction novels, from historical biographies to philosophical thoughts, all kinds of books are the sources from which I draw knowledge and inspiration. Immersed in the world of books, it seems that I can travel through time and space, have conversations with the wise from ancient and modern times and all over the world, and feel the collisions of different cultures and ideas. Each book is a unique world. Reading has broadened my horizons, increased my knowledge, and cultivated my thinking ability and imagination.

## Music & Arts

Music is also one of my dearest loves. Whether it's the passionate rock music, the melodious classical music, or the rhythmic pop music, they can all touch my heartstrings. In my leisure time, I like to put on my headphones and listen to my favorite songs, allowing the melody of the music to take away the fatigue and troubles of life. For me, music is not only a form of entertainment but also an emotional sustenance and expression. It can convey emotions and power that are beyond words, enabling me to find inner peace and resonance in the melody.

## Travel & Exploration

Travel is also an activity that I'm keen on. I love to explore unknown places and appreciate the natural scenery and cultural landscapes of different regions. I once strolled in the ancient European towns, feeling the tranquility and elegance left by the passage of time. I also climbed the magnificent mountains, experiencing the uncanny workmanship of nature and my own insignificance and perseverance. Moreover, I delved into the mysterious tropical rainforests, marveling at the biodiversity and the wonder of the ecosystem. Each trip is a growth experience for me, making me understand and respect this colorful world more, and also allowing me to gain many precious memories and friendships.
